Display of a ttbar candidate event from proton-proton collisions recorded by ATLAS on 4 June 2015, with LHC stable beams at a collision energy of 13 TeV. The red line shows the path of a muon with transverse momentum around 35 GeV through the detector. The green and yellow bars indicate energy deposits in the liquid argon and scintillating-tile calorimeters, from these deposits 4 jets are identified with transverse momenta between 25 and 80 GeV. Tracks reconstructed from hits in the inner tracking detector are shown as arcs curving in the solenoidal magnetic field.
