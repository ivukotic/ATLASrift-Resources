Display of a ttbar candidate event from proton-proton collisions recorded by ATLAS with LHC stable beams at a collision energy of 13 TeV. The red line shows the path of a muon with transverse momentum around 140 GeV through the detector. The green line shows the path of an electron with transverse momentum around 170 GeV through the detector. The green and yellow bars indicate energy deposits in the liquid argon and scintillating-tile calorimeters, from these deposits 3 jets are identified with transverse momenta between 30 and 80 GeV. Two of the jets are identified as having originated from b-quarks. Tracks reconstructed from hits in the inner tracking detector are shown as arcs curving in the solenoidal magnetic field.
